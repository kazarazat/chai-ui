Paginated cards put the page dots in their own bottom row. On `ResultCard` with several results, the row also names the model that made the page showing, and under an image or video the media fades into a dark bar so the label and dots read on any picture. `EditCard`'s version dots move to the same row. `Pagination` is now one slider instead of a button per dot (click picks the nearest dot; arrow keys, Home and End move), so the dots sit 16px apart while still meeting WCAG 2.2's 24px target size. Tests that clicked a dot button by name should click or key the `slider` role instead. New tokens: `gray-80`, `on-media-fade` and the `media-fade` gradient. `ModelOption.label` is documented as a short name with no parentheses. On narrow phones, `SearchMenu`'s panel shifts and shrinks to stay on screen, and the attachment remove buttons in `Composer` and `MediaAnalyzer` always show on touch screens, which can't hover.

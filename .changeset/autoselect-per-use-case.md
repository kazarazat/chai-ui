Auto-select now belongs to the use case it was turned on for. When the end user owns the switch (`showAutoSelectToggle`), picking another use case turns auto-select off (`onAutoSelectModelChange(false)` in React, `update:autoSelectModel` in Vue), so the new use case's model is picked by hand instead of silently auto-selected. A builder's own `autoSelectModel`, with no switch shown, is left as set. Tokens: new `--chai-color-root-amber-30`, an amber dark enough for text on light surfaces.

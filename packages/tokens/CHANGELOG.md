### Patch Changes

- 892c9e9: `gradient.media-fade` is now built from `color.semantic.media-backdrop`, so setting `--chai-color-semantic-media-backdrop` on `:root` recolors the fade and the bar under paginated media together, with no seam. It looks the same with the default black. Override `--chai-gradient-media-fade` to replace the fade entirely.
- 5b3d2a9: A softer fade at the bottom of paginated media (`gradient.media-fade`): it stays light most of the way down and turns fully black only where it meets the dark bar, so `ResultCard` and `EditCard` images look less darkened, with no seam.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 39432e5: Paginated cards put the page dots in their own bottom row. On `ResultCard` with several results, the row also names the model that made the page showing, and under an image or video the media fades into a dark bar so the label and dots read on any picture. `EditCard`'s version dots move to the same row. `Pagination` is now one slider instead of a button per dot (click picks the nearest dot; arrow keys, Home and End move), so the dots sit 16px apart while still meeting WCAG 2.2's 24px target size. Tests that clicked a dot button by name should click or key the `slider` role instead. New tokens: `gray-80`, `on-media-fade` and the `media-fade` gradient. `ModelOption.label` is documented as a short name with no parentheses. On narrow phones, `SearchMenu`'s panel shifts and shrinks to stay on screen, and the attachment remove buttons in `Composer` and `MediaAnalyzer` always show on touch screens, which can't hover.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f082cfb: Image editing with marked regions. New `EditCard` component: mark regions on an image, give each its own instruction, zoom and pan, and page through each edit as a new version. `Composer` gets an edit mode (`EDIT_IMAGE_USE_CASE`) with colored region chips, and an edit can be submitted with only regions. `useComposer` takes an `editImage` and returns `edit` for the card. `@chai-ui/core` adds `buildRegionEditPrompt` and `PRECISE_EDIT_MODELS` (Flux 3 Image on Fal); the Fal engine sends `image_urls` to models that take a list. `@chai-ui/tokens` adds six region colors.
  
  `ResultCard` is now full bleed: the media fills the card, with like/dislike/retry/more, details and the page dots floating over its bottom, and download/share/expand on a dark backing at the top. The edit card shares the same floating controls. Paging in both cards slides between pages (skipped for reduced motion).
  
  Also: while auto-select chooses a model, the result card now shows progress right away ("Choosing model…") instead of the previous result. `Pagination` takes an optional `itemLabel`.

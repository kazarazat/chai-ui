# @chai-ui/tokens

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f082cfb: Image editing with marked regions. New `EditCard` component: mark regions on an image, give each its own instruction, zoom and pan, and page through each edit as a new version. `Composer` gets an edit mode (`EDIT_IMAGE_USE_CASE`) with colored region chips, and an edit can be submitted with only regions. `useComposer` takes an `editImage` and returns `edit` for the card. `@chai-ui/core` adds `buildRegionEditPrompt` and `PRECISE_EDIT_MODELS` (Flux 3 Image on Fal); the Fal engine sends `image_urls` to models that take a list. `@chai-ui/tokens` adds six region colors.
  
  `ResultCard` is now full bleed: the media fills the card, with like/dislike/retry/more, details and the page dots floating over its bottom, and download/share/expand on a dark backing at the top. The edit card shares the same floating controls. Paging in both cards slides between pages (skipped for reduced motion).
  
  Also: while auto-select chooses a model, the result card now shows progress right away ("Choosing model…") instead of the previous result. `Pagination` takes an optional `itemLabel`.
